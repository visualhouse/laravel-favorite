## Installation

1. Install the package via Composer

```bash
$ composer require visualhouse/laravel-favorite
```

2. You need to publish the migration to create the `favorites` table:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Visualhouse\LaravelFavorite\FavoriteServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

3. After that, you need to run migrations:

```shell
php artisan migrate
```

## Publishing the config file

Publishing the config file is optional:

```shell
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Visualhouse\LaravelFavorite\FavoriteServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the default content of the config file:

```php
declare(strict_types=1);

return [

    /*
     * The fully qualified class name of the favorite model.
     */
    'model' => \Visualhouse\LaravelFavorite\Models\Favorite::class,

];
```

## Models

Your User model should import the `Favoriteability` trait, `FavoriteabilityContract` implements interface and use it, that trait allows the user to favorite the models.
(see an example below):

```php
use Visualhouse\LaravelFavorite\Traits\Favoriteability;
use Visualhouse\LaravelFavorite\Contracts\FavoriteabilityContract;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FavoriteabilityContract;
{
	use Favoriteability;
}
```

Your models should import the `Favoriteable` trait, `FavoriteableContract` implements interface and use it, that trait has the methods that you'll use to allow the model be favoriteable.
In all the examples I will use the Post model as the model that is 'Favoriteable', that's for example proposes only.
(see an example below):

```php
use Visualhouse\LaravelFavorite\Traits\Favoriteable;
use Visualhouse\LaravelFavorite\Contracts\FavoriteableContract;

class Post extends Model implements FavoriteableContract
{
    use Favoriteable;
}
```

That's it ... your model is now **"favoriteable"**!
Now the User can favorite models that have the favoriteable trait.

## Usage

The models can be favorite with and without an authenticated user
(see examples below):

### Add to favorites and remove from favorites:

If a param is passed in the favorite method, then the model will assume the user with that user model.

```php
$user = User::first();
$post = Post::find(1);
$post->addFavorite($user); // user with that id added to favorites this post
$post->removeFavorite($user); // user with that id removed from favorites this post
$post->toggleFavorite($user); // user with that id toggles the favorite status from this post
```

The user model can also add to favorites and remove from favorites:

```php
$user = User::first();
$post = Post::first();
$user->addFavorite($post); // The user added to favorites this post
$user->removeFavorite($post); // The user removed from favorites this post
$user->toggleFavorite($post); // The user toggles the favorite status from this post
```

### Return the favorite objects for the user:

A user can return the objects he marked as favorite.
You just need to pass the **class** in the `getFavorite()` method in the `User` model.

```php
$user = Auth::user();
$user->getFavorite(Post::class, Article::class); // returns a collection with the Posts the User marked as favorite
```

### Return the users who marked this object as favorite

You can return the users who marked this object, you just need to call the `favoriteBy()` method in the object

```php
$post = Post::find(1);
$post->favoriteBy(); // returns a collection with the Users that marked the post as favorite.
```

### Check if the user already favorite an object

You can check if the Auth user have already favorite an object, you just need to call the `isFavorite()` method in the object

```php
$post = Post::find(1);
$post->isFavorite(); // returns a boolean with true or false.
```
